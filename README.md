# PTMProject

## Description
EPFL Master's Semester project done in collaboration with the Laboratory for Bio-molecular modeling.

Professor of the lab: Prof. Matteo Dal Peraro
Mentors: Zhidian Zhang, Lucien Krapp

The  final goal of the project is to produce a model which can predict the effect of Post Translational Modifications of protein sequences using an architecture proven to be effective for protein-protein interaction prediction. However, the data for this task is sparse and hard/expensive to obtain, thus the project relies on the SKEMPI which provides labeled data for the prediction of the effects of missense mutations. This project should serve as a proof of concept that the transfer learning between the two problems should be possible.
